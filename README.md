# SDL2 Skeleton
### A minimal-nonsense sdl2 skeleton to quickly get started drawing to a frame buffer.

##### Requirements
 - libsdl2-dev

 You will find a demo app in ```app/```, this should be all you need to get started.

 There is some documented nonsense in ```lib/``` that you shouldn't need to touch, but I encourage you to check it out!
